				<p>Here's a situation you're probably familiar with! We've got a light plugged into a wall, and (surprise) it's lit up!</p>

				<h2>Ah!</h2>
				<p>At some point, you've probably learned that electricity is the flow of particles, called <b>electrons</b>, through a wire.</p>
				<p>As the electrons flow through the light bulb, a little bit of the energy of their motion is converted into the light energy that the bulb emits.</p>
				<p>But why do the electrons flow at all? Let's take an even <i>closer</i> look.</p>
				<button class = 'btn btn-success' id = 'show-traffic-jam'>Let's Go</button>
				<p>Also, here's a <a class = "text-warning" id = "ac-disclaimer">quick disclaimer about this animation</a></p>
				<p class = "alert alert-warning" id = "ac-disclaimer-text">This animation is a little inaccurate, because wall outlets provide what is called <b>alternating current (AC)</b>. In a real wall-powered circuit, the electrons move back and forth. Instead, in this animation, they move in <b>direct current (DC)</b>: a simple, unidirectional path. Take a look at <a href = "" target = "_blank">this</a> to get a better understanding of AC versus DC.</p>

			<h2>The Coloumb Force</h2>
			<p>The answer is that electrons hate to be around each other. They repel one another due to their negative <b>electric charge</b>.</p>
			<p>The repulsive interaction between the two electrons is known as the electric force, or the <b>Coloumb force</b>. Let's explore how this force works.</p>
			<p>On the right, an electron's been anchored to the center of the screen. Click to place an electron anywhere around the electron, and see where it goes!</p>
			<p>The results of your experiments will be tabulated below. You'll be able to click "Next" when you've collected enough data points from both close to and far away from the central electron.</p>

			<p>Do you see a trend in the data?</p>

			<p><a>No, what is it?</a></p>
			<div class = "alert alert-success" id = "coloumb-relation-explanation">
				<p>Excellent! You can see that as distances get really small, the repulsion is really, really large! Conversely, on the right, you can see that despite growing the distance quite a bit, the repulsion doesn't change by very much.</p>
				<p>This type of relation is actually called an <b>inverse square law</b>, because the repulsion is proportional to the reciprocal of the square of the distance. We write this as F &prop; 1/d<sup>2</sup></p>.

				<h2>A Violent, but Balanced Force</h2>
				<div id = "positive-page-1">
					<p>You've just seen an example of how negative charges can repel negative charges, and how that repulsion depends on the distance between negative charges.</p>
					<p>But have you ever heard the saying "opposites attract and like repels?" The concept actually has its origins in electricity. The counterpart of negative charges (the electron) are <b>positive charges</b>, which attract negative particles!</p>
					<p>You can explore this idea in the same simulation as we had before. This time, press shift while you're clicking to place a positive charge (in this simulation, it's a special type of positive charge called a <b>positron</b>) instead of a negative one!</p>
					<button type="button" id = "positive-page-action-2" class="btn btn-success">What do you notice?</button>
				</div>
				<div id = "positive-page-2">
					<p>The positive charges move with pretty much the same speed, but in the opposite direction, right?</p>
					<p>This is because everything about the particles we've got here is the same, except for their charge. The "oppositeness" of the charge basically flips the motion around! In fact, since this particular particle is exactly like an electron except for its charge, it's called a <i>positron</i> or sometimes even an <i>antielectron</i>. It's very different from a proton, which you may have heard is a component of the nucleus of atoms. The proton is a lot more massive than the positron, and is fundamentally a different type of matter.</p>
					<p>You now know that like charges repel, but opposite charges attract. So I've got an interesting problem for you...</p>

				<img src = "http://www.livescience.com/images/i/000/047/720/original/lithium-atom.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&downsize=*:600"></div>
				<p>Protons attract electrons, and repel other protons. If you’re familiar with a basic model of the atom, you know that the nucleus is comprised of protons and non-electrically charged particles called neutrons. So why does the nucleus stay together?</p>
				<p>This problem puzzled scientists for decades. We’ll take a look at this issue, and our modern resolution of it, in the next module.</p>
